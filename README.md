# danR utilities

This package contains generic utilities for R. Many of them are for interacting with Stan files (either via rstan or cmdstanr), and others are more generic stats utilities, such as calculating parameters for different distributions matching a mean and variance.

Because this is an ad-hoc collection, not all functions may be updated; please contact Dan Thal ([dthal\@mathematica-mpr.com](mailto:dthal@mathematica-mpr.com){.email}) with any questions or issues.
